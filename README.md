This module contains an implementation of the System.Drawing API using
Apple's CoreGraphics engine. With the exception of a couple of APIs
to integrate into the native platform, the API is identical to what
developers are used to.

This works with both iOS and OSX, using Xamarin.Mac Unified and Xamarin.iOS
Unified.

You will need a checkout of Mono as a peer module to this module.
